# setllite app
today we will be building an app for viewing satellites !
i will be using a local API and building out the front end of this app,satellite app.

# Setup
run this command to get the backend started
```sh
json-server --watch db.json
```
Test the server by visiting the route in the browser:
[http://localhost:3000/satellites](http://localhost:3000/satellites)
Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.
Write your code in the `index.js`file.
the base URL of the API will be
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
